**KIND WALLET**

Inspiration
The inspiration for KindWallet came from the growing need to create an accessible and impactful platform that encourages individuals to contribute to their communities. We saw the opportunity to bridge the gap between local NGOs and people looking for ways to volunteer, while also incentivizing kindness through a reward system. By combining technology with community spirit, we wanted to create a platform that promotes giving back and supports local businesses.

What it does
KindWallet is a web app that connects users with local volunteering opportunities through a location-based interface. The platform offers two distinct interfaces: one for NGOs and community organizations, and another for everyday users seeking to make a positive impact. NGOs can post tasks, events, and volunteering opportunities, while users are recommended nearby tasks based on their location. As users participate in these activities, they earn “Kind Coins,” which can be redeemed for discounts at local businesses, further motivating users to engage and give back.

How we built it
We developed KindWallet using React.js, with a primary focus on usability and functionality. The platform leverages a geoLocation API to recommend tasks to users based on their proximity to NGOs and volunteer opportunities. NGOs have their own dashboard (yet to be implemented) to easily post and manage events and tasks. The user interface is designed to be simple, intuitive, and responsive, allowing users to easily find, sign up for, and track their volunteering efforts and kind coins. The reward system, which includes Kind Coins, integrates seamlessly with local business partners to offer users meaningful incentives for their kindness.

Challenges we ran into
One of the key challenges we faced was integrating the Location API in a way that accurately recommended tasks to users based on both their location and their personal preferences. We also encountered difficulties ensuring the routing of one webpage to another, and the basic setup of the project as this was all of our first foray into web development.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We’re incredibly proud of building the framework of a platform that could successfully allow us to connect NGOs with volunteers and create a sustainable cycle of kindness if implemented further. The integration of location-based recommendations ensures users are always connected to relevant opportunities. We’re also proud of the user-friendly interface, which makes the process of volunteering and earning rewards simple and enjoyable.

What we learned
Through the development of KindWallet, we learned the importance of designing for both ease of use and functionality. We also learned how powerful location-based technology can be in connecting people to real-world opportunities and how small acts of kindness can be amplified through community collaboration.

What's next for Kind Wallet
In the future, we plan to expand KindWallet’s features by adding more personalized user recommendations based on user preferences and past activities. Additionally, we aim to build the NGO interface of the platform and partner with local businesses to expand the rewards system and create a more seamless integration between the community and local commerce. Additionally, we’d like to improve the platform’s scalability, ensuring it can handle larger volumes of users and NGOs.
